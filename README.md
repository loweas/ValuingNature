# Valuing Nature
This page is for students in NREM 691 Valuing Nature.

## Course description
This course introduces empirical methods at the current frontiers of research in environmental valuation which relies heavily on environmental and resource economics. This fulfils a concentration area of MEM students seeking Environmental Policy & Economics. General topics include the identification of non-market values, revealed, and stated preference methods, environmental policy evaluation, land-use modeling, and climate econometrics.

## Prerequisites: 
Students should be familiar with treatment of micro theory and econometrics. Past training in environmental economics, econometrics, and experience with statistical software and programming will be useful but is not required.

## Course Content and Learning Objectives
My objectives for this course are to:
1.	Provide students with a solid foundation in the recent advances in the empirical methods related to the valuation of environmental goods and services.
2.	Increase studentsâ€™ ability to define empirical environmental and resource economic problems, analyze information, and develop research questions.
3.	Provide students with a foundation for conducting applied research in environmental and resource using sound practices in both academia and policy (e.g M.S Thesis or Ph.D. dissertation)

And to satisfy NREM Graduate Student Learning Outcomes (SLO's): 
1.	Students can analyze and address natural resource and environmental management problems by using appropriate methods from social and/or natural science disciplines
2.	Students communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to diverse audiences including professionals, resource managers, local communities and policy makers


### NREM Graduate Student Learning Outcomes

As well as additional student outcomes:
1.	Pursue research on a range of topics in environmental economics and non-market valuation and, for those seeking employment in academia, teach a similar course to this one in the future.
2.	Explain the models of non-market valuation and have the foundational knowledge to understand the challenges and apply the methods to environmental and resource issues.
3.	 Describe and critically evaluate the empirical evidence relevant to the application of models to environmental and natural resource issues.
4.	Frame and discuss environmental and resource issues and the current policies treatment of these resources in policy decision-making.

## Course Assignments, Evaluation and Grading
#### Participation 25% 
This course is designed to provide seminar-style discussion of journal articles at the frontier of research in environmental valuation. For this to be successful, active participation in class discussion is necessary and expected. 

Additionally, the NREM and Economic department conduct weekly seminars. NREM has seminars on Wednesday at 3:30 often focused on topics pertaining to management questions. The Workshop Environmental and Energy Presentation (WEER) in the Econ department meets each Monday at noon during the semester. Each student is encouraged to attend every seminar. The participation requirement here is to submit a one-page summary/critique of three (3) presentations. See Seminar Summary assignment on site website for more details. 

#### Student Lecture 25% 
Each student will be assigned two (2) empirical papers to prepare a Full Class lecture to the class. Potential papers for each topic are indicated in the reading list below with an asterisk (*). See Student Lecture assignment on site website for more details. 

#### Referee Reports 15% 
Each student will be assigned two (2) working papers to prepare a referee report to a journal editor. You will be asked to summarize the paper, list and discuss the major strengths and weaknesses, and make a recommendation in which quality tier a paper should be published. Reports will be used in this course to gain experience in critically studying papers. See Referee Report assignment on site website for more details.

Please do not use AI to produce repetive slop. I would rather read your own thoughts on the matter than how everything in the paper is curcial. 
Referee Report #1: Due Sunday October 6th @ 11:55 pm
Referee Report #2: Due Sunday November 10th @ 11:55 pm

#### Research Assignment: 35 %
Research assignment will focus on specific modeling framework during the quarter. Actual data and a set of assignments are assigned and will vary based on the framework. Depending on the size of the class we will have 2 or 3 groups. Each group will be responsible for preparation of a final paper and an in-class presentation during the final exam period. The three main frameworks:

##### 1: Discrete Choice Modeling
##### 2: Recreation Demand Modeling
##### 3: Hedonic Property Value Modeling

For each project we will have a practice assigment that explore each model futher.
